# The `RUN` instruction installs the necessary dependencies and sets up the environment:
# 1. Create a virtual environment in `/py`. This ensures that dependencies are installed in an isolated environment.
# 2. Upgrade pip to the latest version to avoid issues with outdated versions.
# 3. Install the PostgreSQL client (`postgresql-client`) needed to interact with the database.
# 4. Install build dependencies (`build-base`, `postgresql-dev`, `musl-dev`) required to build some Python packages from source (e.g., psycopg2).
# 5. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file (production dependencies).
# 6. If the `DEV` argument is set to "true", install the additional development dependencies from `requirements.dev.txt`.
# 7. Clean up the `/tmp` directory to reduce the image size by removing unnecessary files after installation.
# 8. Remove the temporary build dependencies (`.tmp-build-deps`) to keep the image lean and minimize the attack surface.
# 9. Add a non-privileged user `django-user` to improve security by running the app as a non-root user.
